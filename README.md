# AdyMob-Factory-Calculator
The AdyMob Factory Calculator is a Python-based application designed for use in furniture workshops. This application helps workers calculate dimensions, costs, and the number of sheets needed for various wood pieces used in furniture manufacturing. It features an intuitive GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to input dimensions and see the calculations in real-time.

Features:

- Intuitive GUI: Simple and user-friendly interface for inputting wood piece dimensions and costs.
- Dynamic Calculation: Automatically calculates perimeter, area, and total cost based on user inputs.
- Unit Conversion: Supports input in meters, centimeters, and millimeters.
- Sheet Calculation: Computes the total number of sheets needed based on the input dimensions and costs.
- Save to Excel: Exports the calculated data to an Excel file for record-keeping.
- Keyboard Navigation: Navigate the input fields using arrow keys for efficient data entry.

Future Goals:

- Enhanced GUI: Improve the graphical interface for a better user experience.
- Cutting Pattern Generation: Implement an advanced algorithm to generate optimal cutting patterns for workers.
- Data Validation: Add more robust input validation to handle various edge cases.
- Localization: Support multiple languages to cater to a wider audience.

Special thanks to my fellow Alexandra for helping with this project.
